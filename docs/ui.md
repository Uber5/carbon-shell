## Uber5 Carbon Shell

(tell something about this package...)

### TODOs

- [ ] Icons on the right are hard coded and have no function. Make configurable with reasonable defaults.
- [ ] The [doc/styleguide](https://uber5.github.io/carbon-shell/) displays the header as its own header, and overlaps documentation content.
